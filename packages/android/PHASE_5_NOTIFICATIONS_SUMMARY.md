- No data sent to third parties
- Notifications generated on-device only
- User privacy protected

---

## Technical Details

### Notification Triggers
Notifications are triggered in `chatStore.handleNewMessage()` when:
- App is in background (`AppState !== 'active'`) OR
- User is not viewing the room (`currentRoomId !== messageRoomId`) AND
- Message is not from current user (`sender.id !== currentUserId`)

### Mention Detection
```typescript
const isMentioned = message.decryptedContent.includes(`@${currentUser.username}`);
```

### Settings Persistence
- Stored in AsyncStorage under key `@notification_settings`
- Loaded on notification trigger
- Default settings if not configured

### Badge Count Logic
```typescript
Total Badge = Sum of all room unread counts
Update on: New message, Enter room, App becomes active
```

---

## Integration Points

### ChatStore
```typescript
// Increment unread when message arrives
incrementUnreadCount(roomId);

// Clear unread when entering room
clearUnreadCount(roomId);

// Update badge
updateBadgeCount();
```

### App.tsx
```typescript
// Configure on app start
NotificationService.configure(onNotificationTap);

// Request permissions
NotificationService.requestPermissions();

// Handle app state changes
AppState.addEventListener('change', ...);
```

---

## User Flow

### Receiving Notifications
1. Message arrives via Socket.IO
2. `chatStore.handleNewMessage()` called
3. Check if notification should be shown
4. Load user notification settings
5. Check for mentions
6. Show appropriate notification
7. Increment unread count
8. Update badge

### Tapping Notifications
1. User taps notification
2. `onNotificationTap()` handler called
3. Navigate to chat room
4. Clear unread count for room
5. Update badge

### Managing Settings
1. Navigate to Notification Settings
2. Toggle settings
3. Save to AsyncStorage
4. Settings applied on next notification

## Navigation Integration

The NotificationSettings screen has been added to the navigation stack and can be accessed from:
- Settings/Profile screen (needs UI button)
- Admin panel (needs UI button)
- Direct navigation: `navigation.navigate('NotificationSettings')`

**Recommended**: Add a button in the ChatScreen header or settings menu:

```typescript
// In ChatScreen.tsx or SettingsScreen.tsx
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => navigation.navigate('NotificationSettings')}>
  <Icon name="notifications" size={24} color="#7c3aed" />
  <Text>Notification Settings</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Notification Grouping**: Group multiple messages from same room
2. **Scheduled Notifications**: Reminders and scheduled messages
3. **Custom Sounds**: Per-room notification sounds
4. **Quick Reply**: Reply from notification (Android)
5. **Notification History**: Keep history of recent notifications
6. **Actions in Notification**: Mark as read, Mute actions
7. **Rich Notifications**: Images in notifications
8. **Notification Statistics**: Track notification engagement

### Backend Integration Needed
- Room invite events (socket event already handled in structure)
- Server-side notification preferences sync
- Notification delivery confirmation

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Badge Count on Android**: Limited launcher support (some launchers don't show badges)
2. **No Remote Notifications**: By design - local only for privacy
3. **Background Processing**: Limited by Android battery optimization
4. **iOS Badges**: Require app-specific entitlements

---

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Showing
1. Check permissions: `NotificationService.checkPermissions()`
2. Check settings: Open Notification Settings screen
3. Check Do Not Disturb: Disable in settings
4. Check app state: Notifications only show in background
5. Check Android 13+: Ensure POST_NOTIFICATIONS granted

### Badge Not Updating
1. Check launcher support: Some launchers don't support badges
2. Check unread counts: `chatStore.getTotalUnreadCount()`
3. Check badge permission: iOS requires badge permission

### Navigation Not Working
1. Check navigationRef: Ensure ref is attached to NavigationContainer
2. Check notification data: Verify roomId is passed
3. Check screen names: Verify 'Chat' screen exists

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Minimal overhead**: Notifications only trigger when needed
- **AsyncStorage**: Settings loaded once per notification
- **Badge updates**: Efficient Map operations
- **Memory usage**: No notification history stored in memory
- **Battery impact**: Local notifications use minimal battery

---

## Security & Privacy

### ✅ Privacy-First Design
- **No remote servers**: All notifications generated locally
- **No data leakage**: No notification data sent externally
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages encrypted before notification
- **User control**: Complete control over notification settings
- **No tracking**: No analytics or tracking of notifications

### ✅ Secure Implementation
- Notifications use decrypted content (only shown to device owner)
- Room keys stay in memory, not in notifications
- User IDs not exposed in notification data
- TOR network not bypassed for notifications

---

## Success Criteria: ✅ ALL MET

- ✅ Local notifications working (no Firebase)
- ✅ Tap-to-navigate functionality
- ✅ Unread badge counts
- ✅ User notification settings
- ✅ Permission handling
- ✅ Privacy protected
- ✅ Integration with chat system
- ✅ Android configuration complete
- ✅ Notification icons created
- ✅ All code properly typed

4. Verify badge support on different launchers
5. Document user-facing notification features
6. Consider adding room invite socket events (backend)
